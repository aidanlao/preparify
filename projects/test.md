### How to Start a React App

Creating a React app is easy and straightforward. Follow these steps to get started:

---

#### 1. Install Node.js and npm

Before you begin, make sure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your computer. You can download them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

To check if they are installed, run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

#### 2. Create a New React App

Use the official React tool **Create React App** to set up your project. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Here:
- `npx` is a package runner that comes with npm 5.2+.
- `my-app` is the name of your project folder. You can choose any name.

This will create a new folder called `my-app` and install all the necessary dependencies.

---

#### 3. Navigate to Your Project Folder

Move into the project folder:

```bash
cd my-app
```

---

#### 4. Start the Development Server

Start the React app by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will:
- Start a development server.
- Automatically open your app in the default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

#### 5. Modify the App

Edit the `src/App.js` file to see the changes in your app. For example, replace the content of the `<div>` tag with:

```jsx
<h1>Welcome to My First React App!</h1>
```

---

#### 6. Build for Production

When your app is ready for deployment, build it for production with:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized `build/` folder with your app's files.
